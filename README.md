# PyServe

PyServe is a lightweight, local‑network file sharing server with a clean web dashboard, per‑device upload identification, secure delete passwords, and a modern UI.  
It runs entirely on LAN so it does ***not*** go to any servers.

> [!CAUTION]
> PyServe is intended for LAN use *only*.
> Using PyServe on a public network could expose your device to **malware**.

## ✨ Features

- 📁 File Upload & Download
- 🔐 Secure Delete System
> Every uploaded file receives a **unique delete password**:
> Password shown **only once** to the uploader  
> Required to delete the file  
> Prevents other users on the network from deleting your uploads  

### 🖥️ Per‑Device Identification
Each device is assigned a persistent ID:
```
<platform>-<random>.hidden
```
Your own uploads are highlighted in **blue**.
